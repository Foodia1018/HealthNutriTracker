Tech Stack: Flask + PostgreSQL + Blockchain API (e.g., BlockCypher)

Main Workflow:
	•	Signup Route:
	•	On registration, generate BTC wallet (optional)
	•	Auto-credit user wallet: balance += $50

@app.route("/signup", methods=["POST"])
def signup():
    user = create_user(request.form)
    user.btc_balance = 50
    db.session.commit()
    return redirect("/dashboard")

	•	Deposit Route:
	•	User clicks deposit
	•	Show wallet address & QR
	•	Use webhook or cronjob to monitor address for new tx
	•	When confirmations == 3, double deposit & update user balance

def check_confirmations(txid):
    # Call blockchain API
    # Return True if confirmed

	•	Balance Update:
	•	Add deposited amount to $50 bonus
	•	Schedule x2 balance boost every 3 days
	•	Withdraw Route:
	•	Enable after confirmation
	•	Accept user’s external BTC address
	•	On click, simulate processing (5s spinner), then confirm

@app.route("/withdraw", methods=["POST"])
def withdraw():
    if user.confirmed_deposit:
        send_btc(user.wallet, request.form["btc_address"], user.btc_balance)
        user.btc_balance = 0
        return render_template("success.html")
